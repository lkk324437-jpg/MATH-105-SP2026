      <ul>
        <li><term>ALEKS</term> ALEKS is a Web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning system that uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows, and doesn't know, in a course.  
          ALEKS then instructs the student on the topics he or she is most ready to learn. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> <alert>Initial Knowledge Check:</alert> Must complete first before you can access other contents in the 
               course. This will help the system to determine your background and adjust the level of 
               content for you to start and practice.

            <li>
              <p> <alert>Syllabus Quiz:</alert> The syllabus quiz consists of questions from the syllabus. 
                You must receive 100% to activate all bi-weekly knowledge checks. Three attempts are allowed 
                initially and the last question needs to be graded manually. Contact the instructor asap if you don’t 
                reach 100% within 3 attempts.  </p>

                Deadlines of weekly homework are mostly on Saturday. Each question in the weekly homework allows the maximum of 2 attempts and 
                it must be submitted within 30 minutes after starting it. E-text, examples,  or example explanation are accessible.

                It provides regular reviews to prepare for exams. You must receive 100% on the 
                syllabus quiz to activate all quizzes. Each quiz allows  two attempts within a 3-day period 
                (Friday-Monday) with a time limitation. 
                Late submissions are allowed with the daily deduction of 33%.   </p>

                    <p>On Thursday, you will be in a regular classroom and we will review and practice topics that you and other students find challenged, then we will wrap up the topics for that week by working on 
                      additional problems, particularly word problems.

          <p>You will need a notebook.  Problems should be done on paper, and the answers then entered in ALEKS; a neat notebook, complete with date and problem headings,
             will help you a great deal when it is time to study for exams or seek helps. 
          </p>
